# Image Toggle
**Simple one click image toggle extension for google Chrome**

# About

Chrome already has Content Setting to control image visibility but I feel it is not much useful. It also allows to exclude list of hosts but for the given host it is either show images or don't show images. It doesn't allow quickly enable/disable images without saving the settings and then refreshing the page. 

I wanted something simple and one click ability to show/hide images on the page I am viewing. No need to save settings or refresh page. Sometimes while I read the content, I want to focus on the textual content before I look at the images and not to get distracted by those images (sometimes animating ones).  

This is my try at building one such simple, one click chrome extension to toggle images quickly.  It toggles background images too. I am still working on it, trying locally myself. I will try to publish it on chrome webstore once it is fully baked. 

# Try it out

Here's the early version if you'd like to try it out. 

**http://rawgit.com/rpatil26/chrome-image-toggle/master/image-toggle.crx**

Download, drag and drop it in your chrome://extensions/ page to install. It doesn't do anything harmful.
